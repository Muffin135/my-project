        Working LED #1: This LED works because the power and ground wires are connected to the end leads of the resistor and LED, respectively, and the circuit is completed by the resistor and LED connecting adjacently at row 500.

        Challenge #1: This code is meant to make the LED blink in pattern. To begin with, we had to import the RPi.GPIO library so that we could use the GPIO pins on the side of the Raspberry PI to connect to the LED. Then, we wrote 'GPIO.Setmode' so that we could access commands from the GPIO library in our code. We also had to set 'warning' to 'false' on the GPIO settings because if we didn't the code would be blocked from executing since by default the safety features on the Raspberry Pi don't allow direct connections to be made between outside elements and the GPIO pins, due to the risk of malfunction. Next, we wrote, 'GPIO.setup' to tell the Raspberry Pi which GPIO pins we were going to be used, so that they would be unlocked. We also had to designate if they were going to be '.OUT' or '.IN' so that the Raspverry Pi would know which way to send the power. We then used a "For" loop to control the pattern. In this "For" loop, we use the variabe "i" to keep track of the repitions, and set the range to (0, 21, 1), so that the counter would start at 0, end the pattern at 20 repitions (since it is supposed to cancel when it reaches 21, it will only be able to repaeat 20 times), and set the counter to increase by 1 when it went through the pattern once, respectively. When then made the pattern by setting the GPIO 3 pin to ".HIGH" to turn the light on and ".LOW" to turn the light off, respectively. We had the "i" counter print onto the console so that we could se how mant times it had gone through, and then had it print either "LED on" or "LED off" to ensure the code was repeating correctly after each switch. We also put a "time.sleep" between each switch to endure the lights would switch on and off in a timely fashion, rather than in quick succession as they would do without spaces.

        Challenge #3: This code was based off of the code from Challenge 1. In that sense, we kept the "for" loop as a way of repeating the light pattern without having to hard code the pattern, which would have been prohibitively long due to the length requires for the light show. In order to measure the number of times the loop repeated, we used the variable "i" as a reference point from which to begin the pattern. Then we used a "for" loop with a combination of (0, 31, 1) to get the pattern to run 30 times, each time increasing the varaible "i" to keep track of the number of loops. For the pattern itself, we used 3 GPIO pins to control 3 lights on the board, which flashed in a pattern consisting of one long sequence of short flashes followed by a shorter sequence consisting of long, sustained flashes. To play music, we used the onboard "pygame" library to insert a media player. All that was need was to write "import pygame" in the import section, then before the "for" loop began insert 3 lines: one initializing the player (.mixer.init), load up the audio file (.music.load), then run the player (.music.play).
