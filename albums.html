     For Suckins is the first studio album from RB artist Mr. Wuffins. His first independent venture a year after his acrimonious departure from his original project, the EDM group Wolfpack, the album was an immediate critical and commercial success. An excellent representation of the interpersonal connection between Wuffins' personal and professional lives, the album draws on transformative anecdotes in his personal life to distance himself from the previous work and persona he developed as part of Wolfpack. Unlike the rambunctious, trance-like rhythm indicative of Wolfpack tracks, For Suckins is an excercise in self-retrospective at its purest. Punctuated at its end by commentation relevant to the theme of the album, the tracks within form a sort of melodious tone, reminecient of a jaded older relative longing for the day of yore.
